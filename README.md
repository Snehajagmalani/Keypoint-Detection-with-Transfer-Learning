Overview
Keypoint detection consists of locating key object parts. For example, the key parts of our faces include nose tips, eyebrows, eye corners, and so on. These parts help to represent the underlying object in a feature-rich manner. Keypoint detection has applications that include pose estimation, face detection, etc. This project leverages transfer learning techniques to perform keypoint detection effectively.

Features
Keypoint Detection: Identify key points on objects such as facial features.
Transfer Learning: Use pre-trained models to improve accuracy and reduce training time.
Customizable Architecture: Modify the base model and detection layers as needed.
Evaluation Metrics: Measure performance using standard metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Visualization Tools: Visualize keypoints on images for easy interpretation.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/keypoint-detection-transfer-learning.git
cd keypoint-detection-transfer-learning
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Dataset Preparation
Collect and Label Data:

Gather images and annotate keypoints (e.g., nose, eyes, mouth corners, etc.).
Save annotations in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, JSON).
Preprocess Data:

Resize images to a uniform size.
Normalize image pixel values.
Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
Training the Model
Configure Training Parameters:

Define hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs in a configuration file.
Run Training Script:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --config config.yaml
Evaluating the Model
Run Evaluation Script:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py --config config.yaml
View Results:

Check the evaluation metrics output (e.g., MSE, accuracy).
Visualize keypoints on validation/test images.
Inference
Run Inference Script:

bash
Copy code
python inference.py --image_path path_to_image.jpg --model_path path_to_model.pth
View Predicted Keypoints:

The script will display the image with predicted keypoints overlaid.
