# Keypoint Detection with Transfer Learning

## Overview
Keypoint detection involves locating key object parts, such as the nose tips, eyebrows, and eye corners on faces. These key points help represent objects in a feature-rich manner, and have applications in pose estimation, face detection, etc. This project leverages transfer learning techniques to perform keypoint detection effectively.
